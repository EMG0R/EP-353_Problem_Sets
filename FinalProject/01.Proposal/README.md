# Emory Smith Project Proposal

## Title of Project

Ambient generative synthesis/fx processing with JUCE for Raspberry Pi

## Project Summary

I will create a unique and practical generative synthesizer out of a raspberry pi to be used in practical contexts. It will sound awesome and every time the pi is reset it will run a new composition.

## Project Detail

Randomness is the central concept. Taking my taste and experience, I will use JUCE to harness as much randomness as possible while also adhering to a rigit set of limitations that will result in a generative synthesizer that sounds awesome and unique every time it is turned on without the need for user input. I hope for this project to start something with a lasting impact in my life, highlighting the value of coding in a lower level environment like C and my ability to adapt to unfamiliar environments while bringing with me my experience and taste. I want this to be a significant contributor to my portfolio and something I am proud to bring with me and plug in random places. I plan on utilizing LLM support for clarifying syntax and JUCE structure but I will type every word myself. I find it a valid tool in this context considering this is a relatively ambitions project that would be impossible to implement without a high level understanding of all the elements involved so I consider the idea of "cheating" with an LLM in this context to be currently impossible/inconsequential.

## Project Relationship to All Classes

I definitely am pulling heavy inspiration from my max/msp work and I see it as a vivid contribution to my EP-401/491 portfolio but it is fully unique in its use of JUCE and how I will implement with the Pi. I was considering integrating with my RNBO work but I want to prove my ability to adapt to and succeed in C within the class context and to my future teachers/employers but really to myself. 

## Outcome Scale


### Good Outcome

Pi synth makes cool sounds and functions generatively.

### Better Outcome

Generative pi synth makes artistically engaging sound that is useful for focus and fun to have around.

### Best Outcome

Sounds amazing and unique every time it is plugged in, for background sound I want to prefer it to my RNBO pi and I want it to help me get into the MIT media lab or any cool grad program.

## Next Steps

- I need to research JUCE implementation with the Pi
- I need to work on implementing my current generative RNBO structure in JUCE
- need to find ways to improve structure, utilizing elements impossible in RNBO
