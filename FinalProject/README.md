## Description

The final project is an opportunity to take your newly acquired audio programming skills in C/C++ to develop your very own piece of audio software. So long as your project draws upon the course materials, the nature of your project is entirely up to you. Please remember that your project does need to get approved by the instructor. Your audio software may be a game, synthesizer, audio effect, math or science application, or anything else you choose. This is a wide-open project, and you are expected to be creative in your approach to it. Build something that interests you and that you can take with you outside this course.

## Starter Ideas
Here are just some of the ideas for your final project:

- With [JUCE](https://juce.com/):
	- Create an original synthesizer.
	- Create an original audio effect processor.
	- Compose an algorithmic music.
	- Send OSC messages to other music apps.
- Write a music application using [bela](https://bela.io/), [Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy), or [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).

## Example Past Student Projects

**Chunker**|Real-time audio chopper0upper
**2A03/VRC6-based Synthesizer Simulation**|A music synthesis program based on the Nintendo Entertainment System and its audio synthesis hardware.
**Harmonic Ear Training**|A harmonic ear training program with user-generated chords.
**Auditory Analysis by Critical Bandwidth**|A FFT program to compare the frequency bins to critical bandwidths to determine the relative energy between the bandwidths.
**Shepard Tone-Controllable Scale**|A three-octave Shepard tone effect based on the note the user chooses.
**Revolution Mine**|An algorithm that randomly chops audio.

## Schedule

Extensions on the final project are not ordinarily granted except in cases of emergency.

### Proposal

The proposal is your opportunity to receive approval and counsel from your instructor before you proceed to design. Your instructor will either approve your proposal or require modifications for subsequent approval. Your proposal, even if approved, is not binding; you may alter your plan at any point, provided you obtain your instructor's consent for any modifications. You must resubmit your proposal if you made changes to your final project.

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Projects submitted without approval will not receive credit. Communicate with the instructor if you plan to change your project.</p>

Create a new folder named `FinalProject` in your GitHub repository for problem sets. In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder named `Proposal`. Inside the `Proposal`, make a `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Proposal/README.md](./Proposal/README.md). Commit and push your proposal before the deadline.

### Status Report

Not only is the status report intended to keep the instructor apprised of your progress, but it is also an opportunity to keep yourself on track.

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You cannot change your project after the status report due date/time.</p>

In the `FinalProject` folder in your GitHub repository, create another folder named `StatusReport`. Inside the `StatusReport `, make a `README.md` file and answer the questions in [Status/README.md](./Status/README.md). Commit and push your status report before the deadline.

### Final Implementation

<p style="font-size: 16px; color:red;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> No late submission is accepted, except in cases of emergency.</p>

You must submit your software implementation and documentation of your final project via GitHub in the `FinalProject` folder. Your submission thereof must include all of the following:

1. Documentation for your project in `README.md` (You must name this file `README.md`). This documentation is to be a user's manual for your project. Though your documentation structure is entirely up to you, it should be evident to the instructor how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project. Your documentation should be at least **several paragraphs** in length. The instructor should not need to contact you with questions regarding your project after its submission. Hold our hands with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation any questions that you think someone might have while testing your work.

2. A "design document" for your project in the form of a Markdown file called `DESIGN.md` that discusses, technically, how you implemented your project and why you made the design decisions you did. Your design document should be at least **several paragraphs** in length. Whereas your documentation is meant to be a user's manual, consider your design document your opportunity to give the instructor a technical tour of your project underneath its hood.

3. All files required to run your software, including source code and, if applicable, configuration files, sample inputs, SQLite databases, etc. You should thoroughly comment all source codes.

4. A presentation file in PowerPoint (.ppt) or Keynote (.key). Your presentation file should have the following name convention: `EP-353-your-name`. You should have your name, project title, and details you want to convey to your classmates in your presentation. A Keynote file named [PresentationGuideline.key](./PresentationGuideline/PresentationGuideline.key) is included as a guideline for you to prepare your presentation.

As the fourth point suggests, you will be presenting your final project during the last week of the semester. You will be required to demo your software during your 15 minutes presentation. Suppose you fear the live demo will not work during your presentation. In that case, you may consider videotaping your software before the last week of the semester and include it in your presentation. Please **bring your laptop** to present your final project.

Please note that submitting your final project is only accepted through GitHub. The instructor will not accept other forms of submission. Please consult the instructor if you have issues submitting your final project via GitHub *before* the due date.

## Academic Honesty
You will be expected to attribute due credit to the originator of any ideas, words, programming code, or other ideas you incorporate into your work. In computer programming, it's common to use program components written by others known to be reliable and written by others. A lot of program code is freely available online. One must always give full attribution to the original author of all program codes.
