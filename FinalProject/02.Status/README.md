#### Ambient generative synthesis/fx processing with JUCE for Raspberry Pi

***


#### I got more obsessed with C than I ever have before working on this. I have replicated my original system for generative fm synthesis from Csound across to C++ almost exactly with few hurdles. Gaining serious appreciation and understanding for the syntax of JUCE by comparing to Csound.

#### I have not gotten any cmake or JUCE stuff to work on the pi despite hours of trying

#### I know I'm getting close to getting the pi to run but I think I need a bigger SD card. I will bring it to office hour to discuss becasue I am losing my mind working on this.
